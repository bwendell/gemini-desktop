# Oh-My-OpenCode Investigation Plan

- [ ] Inventory local OpenCode/oh-my-opencode configuration and scripts for git cleanup/reset behavior during push.
- [ ] Search local code/config for commands handling "unexpected changes" (clean/reset/checkout) and identify the component responsible.
- [ ] Review external docs/repos for oh-my-opencode/opencode push workflow or auto-clean behavior.
- [ ] Synthesize root cause analysis and recommended mitigation (settings, hooks, or workflow changes).
