# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Gemini Desktop ("the Application") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 1. Data Collection

### Personal Data

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The Application acts strictly as a web wrapper (browser) for `https://gemini.google.com`. Any interaction you have is directly with Google's services.

### Credentials

**We do NOT see, store, or transmit your passwords.**

- Authentication happens directly on Google's secure login pages (`accounts.google.com`).
- The Application uses standard Electron `session` storage to persist your login cookies locally on your device, just like Chrome or Edge.
- We do NOT have access to your raw credentials.

### Telemetry & Analytics

**We do NOT track your usage.**

- No "phoning home".
- No usage analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel).
- No crash reporting that sends data to third parties (logs are stored locally).

## 2. Local Data Storage

All data generated by the Application is stored locally on your device in your operating system's standard application data directory:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\gemini-desktop\`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/gemini-desktop/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/gemini-desktop/`

This data includes:

- Electron cache and cookies (for keeping you logged in).
- Local configuration settings (e.g., window size, theme preference).
- Application logs (for debugging issues locally).

You can delete this data at any time by clearing your application data or uninstalling the Application.

## 3. Network Communication

The Application limits network requests to:

1.  **Google Services:** `*.google.com`, `*.gstatic.com`, `*.googleapis.com` (for the core Gemini functionality).
2.  **GitHub Releases:** `api.github.com` (to check for application updates, if enabled).

We do not proxy your traffic through any third-party servers.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Since this Application loads `gemini.google.com`, you are subject to Google's policies when using their service:

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)
- [Generative AI Additional Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai)

## 5. Security

We implement security best practices to ensure the Application is safe:

- **Sandboxing:** renderer processes are sandboxed.
- **Context Isolation:** Enabled to prevent malicious scripts from accessing Node.js internals.
- **Open Source:** Our entire codebase is open source and available for audit on GitHub.

## 6. Changes to this Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
